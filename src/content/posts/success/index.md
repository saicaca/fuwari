## 信息突破与信息过载：如何在分心海洋中找到突破性知识

**Author's Note:** This article was written over 60 hours with love and care using the blockbuster mental model. If you like my writing style, and you want to create high-quality viral content using the blockbuster approach, you'll love my Blockbuster Blueprint newsletter, which delivers three in-depth articles every week.

**作者注：** 这篇文章是我用区块链思维模型精心撰写的，花费了超过60小时。如果你喜欢我的写作风格，并且想使用这种爆款方法创建高质量的病毒式内容，你会喜欢我的"爆款蓝图"通讯，每周提供三篇深度文章。

This career skill will change the way you think about reading.
"The information we consume matters just as much as the food we put in our body. It affects our thinking, our behavior, how we understand our place in the world. And how we understand others." — Evan Williams, Co-Founder of Twitter and Medium

这项职业技能将改变你思考阅读的方式。
"我们消费的信息与我们摄入体内的食物同样重要。它影响着我们的思维、行为，以及我们如何理解自己在世界中的位置和理解他人。" — 埃文·威廉姆斯，Twitter和Medium联合创始人

Right now, somewhere out in the world is a paragraph, chapter, or book that would change your life forever if you read it. I call this kind of information "breakthrough knowledge," and mastering the ability to find breakthrough knowledge in our era of information overload is one of the most important skills we can develop.

此刻，世界上某处有一段文字、一个章节或一本书，如果你读到它，将永远改变你的人生。我称这类信息为"突破性知识"，而在我们这个信息过载的时代，掌握寻找突破性知识的能力是我们能够培养的最重要技能之一。

We've all had breakthrough experiences. A phrase that a parent, mentor, or teacher said that stuck with us and changed everything. A "quake" book that shook us to our core.

我们都曾经历过突破性体验。父母、导师或老师说的一句话，它深深烙印在我们心中并改变了一切。一本震撼到我们内心深处的"地震级"书籍。

Warren Buffett's quake book, for example, was The Intelligent Investor, which he read when he was 19. This book cemented the core of the investment philosophy Buffett would use throughout his career. Elon Musk's quake book was The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which he said helped him ask bigger questions, and therefore think about addressing larger problems in the world. My most recent quake book was Poor Charlie's Almanack, written by self-made billionaire Charlie Munger. This was the first book that exposed me to mental models. Learning and applying mental models has been so impactful that I recently created the Mental Model of the Month Club.

例如，沃伦·巴菲特的地震级书籍是《聪明的投资者》，他在19岁时阅读了这本书。这本书奠定了巴菲特在整个职业生涯中使用的投资哲学核心。埃隆·马斯克的地震级书籍是《银河系漫游指南》，他说这本书帮助他提出更大的问题，从而思考如何解决世界上更大的问题。我最近的地震级书籍是自制亿万富翁查理·芒格撰写的《穷查理宝典》。这是第一本向我介绍思维模型的书。学习和应用思维模型的影响如此深远，以至于我最近创建了"月度思维模型俱乐部"。

Quake books are rare, but one is worth a thousand merely good books. A breakthrough knowledge experience might only last a few minutes, but its effect can last a lifetime. It is the ultimate form of learning leverage.

地震级书籍很少见，但一本就抵得上千本普通好书。突破性知识体验可能只持续几分钟，但其效果可能持续一生。这是学习杠杆的终极形式。

Now, imagine having a breakthrough knowledge experience once a year rather than once a decade. Or perhaps twice a month rather than once a year. It would change everything, and it's possible.

现在，想象一下每年而不是每十年有一次突破性知识体验。或者每月两次而不是每年一次。这将改变一切，而且这是可能的。

Given the power of breakthrough knowledge and the difficulty of finding it, one of the most fundamental questions we all need ask ourselves is:

考虑到突破性知识的力量和寻找它的难度，我们都需要问自己一个最基本的问题：

How do we use the limited time we have to find breakthrough knowledge in a sea of distraction?

如何利用我们有限的时间在充满干扰的海洋中寻找突破性知识？

My interest in this question is personal. As someone who has read thousands of books across disciplines, I've asked it repeatedly throughout the years. There are hundreds of books scattered among my bookshelves, Amazon shopping cart, Kindle library, and Audible wish lists that I'd love to read, but don't have time for — a veritable "infinite playlist."

我对这个问题的兴趣是个人性的。作为一个阅读过跨学科数千本书的人，多年来我一直在反复问这个问题。在我的书架、亚马逊购物车、Kindle图书馆和Audible愿望清单上散布着数百本我想读但没时间读的书——一个名副其实的"无限播放列表"。

Over time, I've developed a unique approach to handling information overload, based on my own experience and observing how many of the world's top entrepreneurs and leaders learn (including Elon Musk). But before we jump into that approach, we first need to understand the problem. As inventor Charles Kettering once said, "A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved."

随着时间的推移，基于我自己的经验和观察世界顶级企业家和领导者（包括埃隆·马斯克）如何学习，我开发了一种独特的方法来处理信息过载。但在我们深入探讨这种方法之前，我们首先需要了解问题。正如发明家查尔斯·凯特林曾经说过的："一个问题表述清楚就解决了一半。"

(side note: several people have jumped into the comments and shared their favorite quake book or their biggest strategy to find breakthrough knowledge. I'd love to hear from you too, and I read every comment.)

（附注：有几个人在评论中分享了他们最喜欢的地震级书籍或寻找突破性知识的最佳策略。我也很想听听你的想法，我会阅读每一条评论。）

The Four Horsemen of the Info-Apocalypse
Although we think of information overload as one big problem, it actually consists of four problems that are each getting exponentially worse, and that together add up to one big crisis. This crisis risks making us collectively dumber instead of more intelligent, and tearing us apart instead of bringing us together. The crisis goes by many names, but the one that I think is most apt is Info-Apocalypse.

**信息末日的四骑士**
虽然我们将信息过载视为一个大问题，但它实际上由四个问题组成，每个问题都在呈指数级恶化，共同构成一个大危机。这场危机可能会使我们集体变得更愚蠢而非更聪明，使我们分裂而非团结。这场危机有很多名称，但我认为最贴切的是"信息末日"。

The four problems that make up the Info-Apocalypse are:

构成信息末日的四个问题是：

Content Shock
Echo Chambers
Constant Distraction
FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

内容冲击
回音室效应
持续分心
错失恐惧症（害怕错过）

Info-Apocalypse Problem 1: Content Shock
"A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention …" ―Herbert A. Simon

**信息末日问题1：内容冲击**

"信息的财富创造了注意力的贫困..." ——赫伯特·A·西蒙

Source: Mark Schaefer

With the advent of online publishing and social media, the amount of knowledge available to us is expanding so fast that none of us can possibly keep up. Meanwhile, more content is added to the pile every second of every day. The gap between this total collective human knowledge and our time to consume it grows larger every second.

来源：马克·谢弗

随着在线出版和社交媒体的出现，可供我们使用的知识量正在以如此快的速度扩展，以至于我们谁都无法跟上。同时，每天每秒都有更多内容被添加到这个堆积中。这个总体集体人类知识与我们消费它的时间之间的差距每秒都在扩大。

The problem: Much new information and many new skills we could learn are out there, but they're so buried that we don't even know they exist.

问题：许多我们可以学习的新信息和新技能都存在，但它们被深深埋藏，以至于我们甚至不知道它们的存在。

The problem: Much new information and many new skills we could learn are out there, but they're so buried that we don't even know they exist.

问题：大量我们可以学习的新信息和新技能就在那里，但它们被深深地埋藏着，以至于我们甚至不知道它们的存在。

Info-Apocalypse Problem 2: Echo Chambers

信息末日问题2：回音室效应
Source: Michael Simmons
As groups grow in size, they become less stable and more diverse, eventually fracturing into subgroups. One of the most identifiable examples of this phenomenon is religion. Judaism grows until it branches into several different sects, one of which breaks off into Christianity. Christianity grows, then branches into Catholic and Protestant. Protestantism grows, then branches into Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, and so on.

来源：Michael Simmons
随着群体规模的扩大，它们变得不那么稳定且更加多样化，最终分裂成子群体。这种现象最明显的例子之一是宗教。犹太教发展壮大，直到它分支为几个不同的教派，其中一个分支演变成基督教。基督教发展壮大，然后分支为天主教和新教。新教继续发展，又分支为浸信会、卫理公会、路德会等等。

This happens in every growing field, discipline, and community. Each new group develops its own language and culture. While this improves communication inside the group, it makes it harder for knowledge to travel in or out, because it must be linguistically and culturally translated first.

这种情况发生在每个发展中的领域、学科和社区。每个新群体都发展出自己的语言和文化。虽然这改善了群体内部的沟通，但也使知识难以进出，因为知识必须首先经过语言和文化的翻译。

Each group develops an identity based, in part, on how it's different or better than other groups. These conceptual walls between groups lead to polarization and prejudice. It's easy to see this happening in religion and politics, but it happens in all fields: Artists who become too business-oriented are considered "sellouts." Business executives often look down on academics as too theoretical and not practical. Many people in the hard sciences don't even consider social sciences an actual science. Academics who write popular books are considered to be less serious researchers.

每个群体都会形成一种认同感，部分基于它与其他群体的不同或优势。这些群体间的概念墙壁导致极化和偏见。在宗教和政治中很容易看到这种现象，但它实际上发生在所有领域：变得过于商业化的艺术家被视为"叛徒"。商业高管常常看不起学者，认为他们太理论化而不实用。许多自然科学领域的人甚至不认为社会科学是真正的科学。写通俗书籍的学者被认为是不那么严肃的研究者。

The problem: Each group lives in its own echo chamber, which it believes is the "true" reality, and it fights to maintain this belief by demonizing other groups. And in an age of social media and targeted, personalized content, these echo chambers become even more insular (see The Filter Bubble for more on this), as we're exposed to less and less information outside our own chosen groups.

问题：每个群体都生活在自己的回音室中，认为这是"真实"的现实，并通过妖魔化其他群体来维护这种信念。在社交媒体和定向、个性化内容的时代，这些回音室变得更加封闭（关于这点可参见《过滤泡沫》），因为我们接触到的我们选择的群体之外的信息越来越少。

Info-Apocalypse Problem 3: Constant Distraction

信息末日问题3：持续分心

Source: Former Facebook Exec: Social Media Ripping Apart Society
Interviewer: You said that this is a time for soul searching in social media businesses and you were part of building the largest one. What soul searching are you doing right now on that?

来源：前Facebook高管：社交媒体正在撕裂社会
采访者：你说这是社交媒体企业反思的时候，而你曾参与建立了最大的一个。你现在在这方面做什么样的反思？

Chamath Palihapitiya: I feel tremendous guilt … I think we all knew in the back of our minds, even though we feigned this whole line of, "There probably aren't any really bad unintended consequences." I think in the back, deep, deep, deep recesses of our minds, we kind of knew something bad could happen.

Chamath Palihapitiya：我感到极大的内疚……我想我们心里都知道，尽管我们假装说"可能不会有什么真正糟糕的意外后果"。但在我们内心深处，我们某种程度上知道可能会发生一些不好的事情。

About five years ago, I interviewed the founder of Meetup. Somehow we got talking about social media news feeds, and he said something that has stuck with me: "If you think this is addictive, just wait until five years from now."

大约五年前，我采访了Meetup的创始人。不知怎的，我们谈到了社交媒体的信息流，他说了一句话一直让我记忆犹新："如果你认为这已经让人上瘾，那就等着看五年后的情况吧。"
Well, it's five years later, and my relationship with mobile devices, the Internet, and social media has changed in a scary way. As time goes by, I've become extremely vigilant — downloading Chrome extensions like Crackbook Revival and Newsfeed Eradicator), deleting all social media apps from my phone, adding a password that only my wife has so I can't download new apps — and it still feels like I'm losing the battle.

好吧，现在已经过了五年，我与移动设备、互联网和社交媒体的关系已经发生了可怕的变化。随着时间的推移，我变得非常警惕——下载Chrome扩展程序如Crackbook Revival和Newsfeed Eradicator，从手机中删除所有社交媒体应用，添加一个只有我妻子知道的密码，这样我就不能下载新应用——但我仍然感觉自己正在输掉这场战斗。

I can swear off Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube as much as I'd like, but each of these is also where I do work to build my business. I manage Facebook Groups with nearly 50,000 members. I buy Facebook and Google ads and promote new articles on Facebook.

我可以尽可能地发誓不用Facebook、Twitter或YouTube，但这些平台也是我开展业务的地方。我管理着拥有近5万名成员的Facebook群组。我购买Facebook和Google广告，并在Facebook上推广新文章。
I've tried blocking YouTube, but there are so many high-value educational videos there that I decided to turn it back on. Even though I work from home, when I open my computer, it feels like I've set up shop in the middle of a busy bazaar.

我曾尝试屏蔽YouTube，但那里有太多高价值的教育视频，以至于我决定重新启用它。尽管我在家工作，但当我打开电脑时，感觉就像我在一个繁忙的市场中间开店一样。
Marketers, software developers, and hackers are gaining unprecedented access to data on human behavior. They use this information to master the science of capturing people's attention and addicting them to their product. Billions of dollars are spent every year toward these ends. They have developed business models based on advertising — or spreading misinformation — to get the maximum number of clicks for the least amount of effort.

营销人员、软件开发者和黑客正在获得对人类行为数据前所未有的访问权。他们利用这些信息来掌握吸引人们注意力并使他们对产品上瘾的科学。每年数十亿美元被花在这些目的上。他们已经开发出基于广告的商业模式——或传播错误信息——以用最少的努力获得最大数量的点击。
To complicate things further, in the not-too-distant future, a significant percent of humanity may be looking at life through augmented virtual-reality glasses or contact lenses, which will make the problem even worse.

更为复杂的是，在不远的将来，相当一部分人可能会通过增强现实眼镜或隐形眼镜来看待生活，这将使问题变得更糟。
The problem: Our physical and virtual environments are surrounded by more and more content — whether editorial, advertising, or "fake news." This content is marketed specifically to our own inclinations, which proves a powerful distraction that can keep us from pursuing more useful information or our own goals.

问题：我们的物理和虚拟环境被越来越多的内容包围——无论是编辑内容、广告还是"假新闻"。这些内容专门针对我们自己的倾向进行营销，这证明是一种强大的分心因素，可以阻止我们追求更有用的信息或我们自己的目标。
Info-Apocalypse Problem 4: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

信息末日问题4：错失恐惧症(FOMO)
Today, compared to even a decade ago, there is more interesting "I'd love to read or watch this" content than ever. But having more choices is not necessarily a good thing. In fact, it quickly becomes overwhelming.

与十年前相比，如今有更多有趣的"我想读或看这个"的内容。但拥有更多选择并不一定是好事。事实上，它很快变得让人不知所措。
What makes it overwhelming is not the number of options; it's the number of good options. Letting go of good options is painful to humans. It's called loss aversion.

让人不知所措的不是选项的数量，而是好选项的数量。放弃好选项对人类来说是痛苦的。这被称为损失厌恶。
Additionally, this plethora of good options means we often have to make decisions in which there isn't a clear winner. Should we read a book on data science or artificial intelligence in order to future-proof our careers? Should we touch up on our communication skills so we can be a better leader? Or should we read the latest workout research, diet book, or parenting guide to take our personal life to the next level? All of these areas are important, and comparing them can feel like comparing apples to oranges to almonds.

此外，大量的好选项意味着我们经常必须做出没有明确赢家的决定。我们应该阅读关于数据科学或人工智能的书籍以保证我们职业的未来吗？我们应该提高我们的沟通技能，以便成为更好的领导者吗？或者我们应该阅读最新的锻炼研究、饮食书籍或育儿指南，将我们的个人生活提升到一个新水平？所有这些领域都很重要，比较它们感觉就像比较苹果、橙子和杏仁一样困难。
We find these kinds of decisions extremely challenging psychologically.

从心理上讲，我们发现这些类型的决定非常具有挑战性。
Problem: Too many good options combined with not enough foreknowledge on which is best means we're constantly second-guessing our choices.

问题：太多好选项加上缺乏足够的先见之明来判断哪个最好，意味着我们不断地对自己的选择产生怀疑。
The Result: A Daily Diet of Media Junk Food

结果：每日媒体垃圾食品饮食
These four challenges (content shock, echo chambers, constant distractions, and FOMO) make it so that the average person who is not deliberate will tend toward a media diet of "junk food." They will engage with what's presented, click on distractions, and when offered good options, never feel quite sure which is best. In health policy, a "food desert" is a geographic region where healthy food is not available. To those who are not deliberate, the Internet looks more and more like an information desert: full of mostly junk information. Even worse, many people living on "junk food" media diets think they're getting more informed and smarter when the opposite is happening.

这四个挑战（内容过载、回音室、持续分心和FOMO）使得不慎重的普通人会倾向于"垃圾食品"式的媒体饮食。他们会接触呈现在面前的内容，点击分散注意力的东西，当面对好的选择时，永远不确定哪个最好。在健康政策中，"食物沙漠"是指健康食品不可用的地理区域。对于那些不慎重的人来说，互联网越来越像一个信息沙漠：充满了大部分垃圾信息。更糟糕的是，许多依赖"垃圾食品"媒体饮食的人认为他们变得更加见多识广和更聪明，而实际上恰恰相反。
Okay, That's The Problem. What's The Solution?

好的，这就是问题。那么解决方案是什么？
While the Info-Apocalypse paints a potentially bleak picture, the flip side is that there is more breakthrough knowledge available than ever before. There is now more diverse knowledge from the world's top experts in any medium we want, and much of it is free or affordable. Nine years from now, humanity will have doubled the amount of scientific knowledge that has been created by humanity thus far.

虽然信息末日描绘了一幅潜在的暗淡前景，但另一方面是，现在可获得的突破性知识比以往任何时候都多。现在，在我们想要的任何媒介中，来自世界顶级专家的更多样化的知识，而且很多是免费或负担得起的。从现在起九年后，人类将使迄今为止人类创造的科学知识量翻一番。
Let's say I want to learn videography. Twenty years ago, I would've had to find a local class or read a book. Today, I can go on to YouTube and sort through one of the 277,000 results that come up for "learn videography." Or I can literally sign up for an $180 all-access pass on Masterclass and learn directing from Ron Howard, screenwriting from Aaron Sorkin, or filmmaking from Martin Scorsese. On this level — and if we're careful about what we consume — we actually live in an information utopia.

假设我想学习视频制作。二十年前，我必须找一个当地的课程或阅读一本书。今天，我可以上YouTube并浏览搜索"学习视频制作"时出现的277,000个结果中的一个。或者我可以在Masterclass上花180美元购买全部访问权限，从Ron Howard那里学习导演，从Aaron Sorkin那里学习编剧，或者从Martin Scorsese那里学习电影制作。在这个层面上——如果我们对我们消费的内容持谨慎态度——我们实际上生活在一个信息乌托邦中。
As Charles Dickens wrote in A Tale of Two Cities:

正如查尔斯·狄更斯在《双城记》中所写：
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us.

这是最好的时代，这是最坏的时代，这是智慧的时代，这是愚蠢的时代，这是信仰的纪元，这是怀疑的纪元，这是光明的季节，这是黑暗的季节，这是希望的春天，这是绝望的冬天，我们面前有一切，我们面前一无所有。
People who learn to access breakthrough knowledge quickly while minimizing the noise have a huge advantage over others. These people are living in a veritable information cornucopia with lots of juicy fruit. This is the underrated skill.

学会快速获取突破性知识同时最小化噪音的人比其他人有巨大优势。这些人生活在一个真正的信息丰饶之地，有许多丰硕的果实。这是一种被低估的技能。
The only way to make this potential info-apocalypse into a utopia is to change our approach to media from a reactive to proactive one. We cannot passively have faith in the stream on our news feeds, default settings, and notifications to guide us. The companies that control these do not have our best interests in mind, and they have broken the public trust. These feeds are designed for one thing: Keep your attention for as long as possible in the short-term and long-term. This business model is fundamentally conflicted with our own life goals.

将这种潜在的信息末日转变为乌托邦的唯一方法是改变我们对媒体的态度，从被动变为主动。我们不能被动地相信新闻流、默认设置和通知来引导我们。控制这些的公司并没有考虑我们的最佳利益，他们已经破坏了公众信任。这些信息流设计只有一个目的：在短期和长期内尽可能长时间地保持你的注意力。这种商业模式与我们自己的生活目标从根本上冲突。
So how do we find the signal within the noise? The proverbial needle in the haystack? The breakthrough knowledge in a sea of FOMO and distraction? How do we live in an information utopia rather than an info-apocalypse?

那么，我们如何在噪音中找到信号？俗话说的大海捞针？如何在充满FOMO和分心的海洋中找到突破性知识？我们如何生活在信息乌托邦而不是信息末日中？
In the following section, I'm propose three solutions:

在下面的部分，我提出三个解决方案：
Asking yourself a simple question that will help you filter breakthrough knowledge from incremental knowledge.
Using a new knowledge format that has a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
Learning a skill that will help you systematically improve at finding breakthrough knowledge.

问自己一个简单的问题，这将帮助你从增量知识中过滤出突破性知识。
使用一种信噪比更高的新知识格式。
学习一种技能，帮助你系统地提高寻找突破性知识的能力。
Info-Apocalypse Solution 1: Ask The Magic Question In Order To Filter Breakthrough Knowledge From Incremental Knowledge

信息末日解决方案1：问魔术问题，以便从增量知识中过滤出突破性知识
One of the most important distinctions we can make when it comes to learning how to learn is distinguishing between incremental knowledge and breakthrough knowledge. Once you know what you're really looking for, it's easier to find it.

当谈到学习如何学习时，我们可以做的最重要的区分之一是区分增量知识和突破性知识。一旦你知道你真正在寻找什么，就更容易找到它。
Incremental knowledge further confirms what we already know to be true. It is reading yet another book on marketing, when we've already read twenty. It is an interesting tidbit that temporarily entertains, but is quickly forgotten.

增量知识进一步确认我们已经知道的真相。它是阅读另一本关于营销的书，当我们已经读了二十本。它是一个暂时娱乐的有趣花边，但很快就被遗忘。
Breakthrough knowledge, on the other hand, challenges our fundamental beliefs about how the world works or introduces a new lens through which to see the world. It sticks with us.

而另一方面，突破性知识挑战我们关于世界如何运作的基本信念，或者引入一个新的视角来看待世界。它会伴随我们。
Identifying potential breakthrough knowledge is actually fairly easy. There is a question that I ask myself before I consume any media that works as an incredible filter. I simply ask:

识别潜在的突破性知识实际上相当容易。在我消费任何媒体之前，我会问自己一个问题，它作为一个难以置信的过滤器。我只是问：
Does this have the potential to fundamentally change my life?

这是否有可能从根本上改变我的生活？
This power question helps me avoid mindlessly consuming content because it has a good title, shows up in my newsfeed, and just sounds sort of interesting.

这个强大的问题帮助我避免无意识地消费内容，仅仅因为它有一个好标题，出现在我的新闻流中，听起来有点有趣。
The first time I truly understood the difference between the two types of knowledge was when I watched an interview with Elon Musk. The interviewer asks Musk for his biggest advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. Surprisingly, Musk responds:

我第一次真正理解这两种知识之间的区别是在观看埃隆·马斯克的采访时。采访者请马斯克给有抱负的企业家提供最大的建议。令人惊讶的是，马斯克回答：
I remember being surprised when I first heard this. It somehow felt too simple. But then I realized that Musk's approach was much more powerful and fundamental than I had originally thought. It reflects the power of the scientific method.

我记得我第一次听到这个时感到惊讶。这在某种程度上感觉太简单了。但后来我意识到，马斯克的方法比我最初想象的要强大和基础得多。它反映了科学方法的力量。
Let me give you an example you'll recognize. Hundreds of years ago, the idea that the sun orbited the Earth was obvious and a closed case. Although, the notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC, the idea had never received a lot of attention.

让我给你一个你会认识的例子。几百年前，太阳围绕地球运行的想法是显而易见的，是一个已经盖棺定论的事实。虽然地球围绕太阳运行的概念早在公元前3世纪就被提出，但这个想法从未受到太多关注。
Every day throughout history, anybody could watch the sun rise on one side of the Earth and set on the other. Every single shred of people's personal experience seemed to support the prevailing belief.

在历史上的每一天，任何人都可以看到太阳从地球的一侧升起，在另一侧落下。人们个人经验的每一丝碎片似乎都支持当时的普遍信念。

Copernicus overthrew millions of observations over thousands of years with just a few years of research, by using a new instrument (the telescope) in order to collect new data. This data showed him that in fact the Earth orbited around the sun.

哥白尼通过使用一种新仪器（望远镜）收集新数据，仅用几年的研究就推翻了数千年来的数百万次观察。这些数据向他表明，事实上地球围绕太阳运行。

This well-known example points to a powerful idea: Disconfirming evidence — evidence that proves your existing ideas wrong — is exponentially more valuable than confirming evidence. Scientists throughout history have realized this. Science grows by what is proven wrong, not what is proven right.

这个众所周知的例子指向一个强大的观念：反证——证明你现有想法错误的证据——比确认证据具有指数级的更大价值。历史上的科学家们已经意识到这一点。科学的发展是通过证明错误的东西，而不是证明正确的东西。

One piece of disconfirming evidence can be worth a million pieces of confirming evidence just like one breakthrough knowledge book can be worth more than 100 incremental knowledge books.

一条反证可能价值百万条确认证据，就像一本突破性知识的书可能比100本增量知识的书更有价值。

Info-Apocalypse Solution 2: Realize Information Overload Is An Age-Old Problem With Age-Old Solutions

信息末日解决方案2：认识到信息过载是一个古老的问题，有着古老的解决方案

It's worth recognizing that information overwhelm is an age-old problem. The rate of overload may be increasing, but the problem itself is not new.

值得认识到，信息过载是一个古老的问题。过载的速度可能在增加，但问题本身并不新鲜。

Collective human knowledge has been growing exponentially at a faster rate than our ability to process it for a long time.

集体人类知识长期以来一直以比我们处理能力更快的速度呈指数增长。

Philosophers, thinkers, and intellectuals have commented on information overwhelm since time immemorial. Roman philosopher Seneca said:

哲学家、思想家和知识分子自古以来就对信息过载发表评论。罗马哲学家塞内卡说：

What is the use of having countless books and libraries, whose titles their owners can scarcely read through in a whole lifetime? The learner is not instructed, but burdened by the mass of them.

拥有无数书籍和图书馆有什么用处，它们的主人一生几乎无法阅读完其中的标题？学习者没有得到指导，而是被它们的数量所负担。

A 1962 study titled "Information Input Overload " by James G. Miller, Director of the Mental Health Research Institute at the University of Michigan, admonishes, "Since people can't blow a fuse … they must adjust."

1962年，密歇根大学心理健康研究所所长詹姆斯·G·米勒的一项名为"信息输入过载"的研究告诫说："由于人们不能像保险丝一样熔断……他们必须调整。"

A 2007 essay by novelist David Foster Wallace coined the word Total Noise as "a tsunami of available fact, context and perspective" which provides a sensation of a "loss of autonomy, of personal responsibility for being informed." He concludes the essay with the following call to action for all of us:

2007年，小说家大卫·福斯特·华莱士创造了"总噪音"一词，将其描述为"可获取的事实、背景和观点的海啸"，它提供了一种"失去自主权、失去对被告知的个人责任"的感觉。他以以下行动号召结束他的文章：



Part of our emergency is that it's so tempting… to retreat to narrow arrogance, pre-formed positions, rigid filters, the 'moral clarity' of the immature. The alternative is dealing with massive, high entropy amounts of info and ambiguity and conflict and flux; it's continually discovering new areas of personal ignorance and delusion.

我们面临的部分紧急情况是，我们很容易陷入狭隘的傲慢、预设的立场、僵化的过滤器以及不成熟的"道德清晰"中。另一种选择是处理大量高熵的信息、模糊性、冲突和变化；这意味着不断发现个人无知和错觉的新领域。

As with all important age-old problems, we have generations of people who have attempted to solve the problem. Most of those attempts have failed, but some solutions have lived on generation after generation. It's worth noticing what those are and appreciating their value.

与所有重要的古老问题一样，几代人都试图解决这个问题。大多数尝试都失败了，但有些解决方案代代相传。值得注意的是这些解决方案是什么，并欣赏它们的价值。

One lineage of solutions has been knowledge formats that have a higher value-density:

一系列解决方案是具有更高价值密度的知识格式：

The graphic above shows increasing condensed knowledge:

上面的图表显示了日益浓缩的知识：

A social media post is usually a writer's best thought of the day — or in some cases their best thought of the month if they are posting a long article.

社交媒体帖子通常是作者当天最好的想法——或者在某些情况下，如果他们发布长文章，可能是当月最好的想法。

A book is much more valuable because it contains an author's best thoughts of the decade or year. It's also vetted, approved, and edited.

一本书更有价值，因为它包含了作者十年或一年中最好的想法。它也经过审核、批准和编辑。

Book summaries are even more valuable. Over the last five years, we've seen the rise of a cottage industry of these summaries. Search for any bestseller on Amazon, and it's likely you'll see a few book summaries for purchase. Search on Google, and you'll see several for free. Services like Blinkist and Get Abstract have catalogued thousands of book summaries in audio and text format. Book summaries are valuable because not all information within a book is created equal. They provide the most concise description of the book's main ideas, stories, exercises, and takeaways. In this category, I would also include author presentations (e.g., TEDx Talks, Google Talks) and author interviews (e.g., podcasts) on the book. Each of these are condensed overviews of the book.

图书摘要甚至更有价值。在过去的五年中，我们看到了这些摘要的小型产业兴起。在亚马逊上搜索任何畅销书，很可能会看到一些可供购买的图书摘要。在谷歌上搜索，你会看到几个免费的摘要。像Blinkist和Get Abstract这样的服务已经收录了数千本书籍摘要，以音频和文本格式呈现。图书摘要之所以有价值，是因为书中的所有信息并非同等重要。它们提供了关于书籍主要思想、故事、练习和要点的最简洁描述。在这一类别中，我还会包括作者关于该书的演讲（如TEDx演讲、谷歌演讲）和作者访谈（如播客）。这些都是对书籍的浓缩概述。

Field summaries condense whole fields. The best example is the For Dummies guides. Since they were started nearly 30 years ago, they have sold 200 million copies of 2,500+ titles, making them one of the bestselling series of all time.

领域摘要浓缩了整个领域。最好的例子是"傻瓜指南"系列。自从近30年前开始以来，它们已售出了2,500多种书籍的2亿册，使其成为有史以来最畅销的系列之一。

But there's a way to learn that's even more condensed than field summaries. It's called mental models.

但有一种学习方式比领域摘要更加浓缩。它被称为心智模型。

I had a "holy sh*t" moment back in 2013 when I saw the content shock curve and wondered, "What are we going to do about this as a society? What should I do about it?"

我在2013年看到内容冲击曲线时有一个"天啊"的时刻，我想知道，"作为一个社会，我们将如何应对这个问题？我应该怎么做？"

This question started a multi-year zig-zagging journey that has led me ultimately to realize that many of the smartest entrepreneurs in the world structure their knowledge differently from the rest of us. Instead of organizing knowledge into separate disciplines or fields, they use mental models.

这个问题开启了一段多年的曲折旅程，最终让我意识到，世界上许多最聪明的企业家构建知识的方式与我们其他人不同。他们不是将知识组织成独立的学科或领域，而是使用心智模型。

This ultimately led me to do a deep dive on mental models. Mental models are representations of phenomena that have been observed across time, across fields of study, and across domains of life. In my opinion, they deliver the most knowledge value because:

这最终促使我深入研究心智模型。心智模型是对现象的表述，这些现象在时间、研究领域和生活领域中都被观察到。在我看来，它们提供了最大的知识价值，因为：

The knowledge they impart is much more condensed than book summaries or even field summaries.

它们传授的知识比图书摘要甚至领域摘要更加浓缩。

They retain their value over time (and even increase it).

它们随着时间保持其价值（甚至增加价值）。

They are broadly applicable across fields.

它们在各个领域广泛适用。

One of my favorite mental models, for example, is the 80/20 Rule: the idea that 20 percent of efforts or input causes 80 percent of results or output. This rule applies to business, creativity, relationships, health, and many more domains.

例如，我最喜欢的心智模型之一是80/20法则：即20%的努力或投入产生80%的结果或产出。这一规则适用于商业、创造力、人际关系、健康和许多其他领域。

Another example of a mental model is Opportunity Cost, which is the value of the choice of a best alternative cost while making a decision. This model is valuable when making decisions across your entire life, because it encourages you to reflect on what potential alternatives to a decision might be. It prevents you from going with the first choice that comes to your head.

另一个心智模型的例子是机会成本，即在做决定时最佳替代选择的价值。这个模型在你一生中做决定时很有价值，因为它鼓励你思考决定的潜在替代方案可能是什么。它防止你选择脑海中出现的第一个选择。

When you learn mental models, you begin to see the underlying patterns at work in every area of life, and it becomes much easier to spot the signal in the noise. You can read about some of the models I've found most valuable in This Is Exactly How You Should Train Yourself To Be Smarter [Infographic].

当你学习心智模型时，你开始看到生活各个领域中运作的基本模式，从噪音中找出信号变得更加容易。你可以在《这正是你应该如何训练自己变得更聪明》[信息图]中阅读一些我发现最有价值的模型。

Once I understood the power of mental models, I started using them in my life. Some of the first indications that I was experiencing reality in a different way were:

一旦我理解了心智模型的力量，我开始在生活中使用它们。我以不同方式体验现实的一些最初迹象是：

I looked back on many of my old mistakes, and thought to myself, "Oh my God! I can't believe I made that decision. If I had only known XYZ mental model, I would've clearly avoided this."

我回顾了我过去的许多错误，并对自己说："天哪！我不敢相信我做了那个决定。如果我当时知道XYZ心智模型，我肯定会避免这个错误。"

I suddenly was able to make breakthrough progress on problems in my life that I had been stalled in for years … particularly related to money.

我突然能够在生活中那些停滞多年的问题上取得突破性进展...特别是与金钱相关的问题。

I started having many more big, counterintuitive ideas whereas previously many of my ideas had been much more conventional.

我开始有更多重大的、反直觉的想法，而之前我的许多想法都更加传统。

I started talking and writing differently. I related all of my knowledge back to mental models. Each new situation was an example of a greater principle.

我开始以不同方式说话和写作。我将我所有的知识与心智模型联系起来。每个新情况都是更大原则的一个例子。

I was able to see more connections between disciplines.

我能够看到学科之间的更多联系。

I now come upon "aha" knowledge almost daily. I see or read something that either shatters my world view — in a good way — or connects lots of different strands I've been exploring for months or years.

我现在几乎每天都会遇到"啊哈"知识。我看到或读到的东西要么以积极的方式打破我的世界观，要么将我探索数月或数年的不同线索联系起来。

Info-Apocalypse Solution 3: Learn How to Learn

信息末日解决方案3：学会如何学习

Learning how to learn is the bundle of skills that ultimately helps us find breakthrough knowledge and apply it to our life in order to get a result in the least amount of time.

学会如何学习是一系列技能的组合，最终帮助我们找到突破性知识并将其应用到生活中，以在最短的时间内获得结果。

Few people even realize that learning how to learn is its own distinct skill set. As a result, they don't improve.

很少有人意识到学会如何学习是一套独特的技能。因此，他们没有进步。

As it relates to information overload, it includes:

关于信息过载，它包括：

Understanding the scientific method in order to identify high quality information. My favorite resource on this is The Beginning Of Infinity.

理解科学方法以识别高质量信息。我在这方面最喜欢的资源是《无限的开始》。

Understanding the value of diverse knowledge. I write about this in People Who Have "Too Many Interests" Are More Likely To Be Successful According To Research.

理解多样化知识的价值。我在《研究表明，有"太多兴趣"的人更有可能成功》中写到这一点。

Understanding the cognitive biases that lead to us trusting information we shouldn't (e.g., confirmation bias, backfire effect, Dunning-Kruger Effect, halo effect, ingroup bias)

理解导致我们信任不应该信任的信息的认知偏见（例如，确认偏见、适得其反效应、邓宁-克鲁格效应、光环效应、内群体偏见）

Learning how to learn is much larger topic, but these bullet points give you a place to start.

学会如何学习是一个更大的话题，但这些要点给你提供了一个起点。

The Final Take-Away: From Info-Apocalypse To Info-Utopia

最终启示：从信息末日到信息乌托邦

I remember getting a glimpse of how unequal the world was when I spoke to 20 inner city high schools about entrepreneurship when I was a student at New York University. I specifically remember one high school in Harlem that looked more like a prison than a school. All of the windows were boarded over and had bars over them. The building had graffiti on the outside. To get in, I needed to go through a metal detector. The school was surrounded by a fence and abandoned buildings.

我记得当我还是纽约大学的学生时，在向20所内城高中讲述创业精神时，我瞥见了世界是多么不平等。我特别记得哈莱姆区的一所高中，它看起来更像是一座监狱而不是学校。所有的窗户都被木板封住，并装有栏杆。建筑外面有涂鸦。要进入，我需要通过金属探测器。学校被围栏和废弃建筑物包围。

To contrast this with my own experience, my high school was surrounded by flowers, athletic fields, and trees. Almost everyone in my graduating class went to college.

与我自己的经历相比，我的高中周围是鲜花、运动场和树木。我毕业班的几乎每个人都上了大学。

As I walked into the Harlem school, I felt sadness. There was no way you could say that there was equal opportunity. The only difference between which school a student went to was where they happened to be born.

当我走进哈莱姆学校时，我感到悲伤。你无法说这里有平等的机会。学生上哪所学校的唯一区别是他们碰巧出生在哪里。

This disparity is profound. And, it scares me to think that the disparity online might be even larger than the physical world. While everyone with the Internet has equal access, not everyone has an equal understanding of how to use that access. And, as a result, some people are living in an info-apocalypse and others are living in an info-utopia. If we don't take it upon ourselves to learn the skills to manage the online environment, teach those we love, and spread this knowledge to everyone, I fear that society will become even more polarized.

这种差距是深刻的。而且，想到在线差距可能比物理世界更大，这让我感到害怕。虽然所有有互联网的人都有平等的访问权，但并非所有人都对如何使用这种访问权有同样的理解。因此，一些人生活在信息末日，而其他人则生活在信息乌托邦。如果我们不自己学习管理在线环境的技能，教导我们所爱的人，并将这些知识传播给每个人，我担心社会会变得更加两极分化。
