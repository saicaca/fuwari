# So Who Am I Then?

Hello everyone! 👐

My real name is Tran Anh Khoa, though most people in my circle know me simply as Yonnon. I'm absolutely delighted to welcome you to this little corner of the internet I can finally call my own. I've been meaning to create this space for quite some time, and it feels wonderful to finally share it with you all.

## My Professional Journey

I've been working as a Website Developer and Software Engineer for nearly two years now. The digital world has always fascinated me, and I find immense joy in bringing ideas to life through code. I've particularly developed a strong affinity for **VueJs**, **Quasar**, and **Javascript** - there's something about their flexibility and potential that keeps me engaged for hours on end.

Recently, I've been venturing into new territories, diving into **Astro** for its incredible performance benefits and **Golang** for its elegant approach to backend development. Learning these new technologies has been challenging yet incredibly rewarding. There's this special feeling you get when something finally clicks after hours of troubleshooting - developers, you know exactly what I'm talking about!

## Where I Come From

My journey began in the countryside of Vietnam, where life presented its fair share of challenges. Resources were scarce, and opportunities even more so. With determination and support from my family, I managed to move to Ho Chi Minh City to pursue higher education in Information Technology.

I actually found myself thoroughly enjoying my academic pursuits – something that surprised even me! Had scholarship opportunities been available, I might have continued formal education further. Nevertheless, I firmly believe in the power of self-directed learning, which has become an integral part of my daily routine. As anyone in tech knows, the moment you stop learning is the moment you start becoming obsolete!

## My Language Passion

Now, here's something I'm particularly excited to share with you all – I'm absolutely passionate about languages! While coding languages certainly occupy a special place in my heart, human languages have become an equally important passion of mine.

Currently, I can speak **English** and **Chinese** with relative fluency, and I'm making steady progress with **Japanese**. There's something incredibly fulfilling about being able to connect with people from different cultures in their native tongue. Each language offers a unique perspective on the world and opens doors to understanding different ways of thinking.

My language learning journey has taught me persistence, humility, and the value of making mistakes (plenty of embarrassing language mix-ups I could share!). I find the process of acquiring new languages remarkably similar to learning programming languages – both require understanding patterns, practicing consistently, and building upon foundational knowledge.

I often spend my evenings watching films without subtitles, chatting with language exchange partners, or reading books in my target languages. It's a wonderful way to unwind while still feeding my insatiable curiosity about the world.

## What's Next?

In the coming posts, I'm excited to share some of the projects I've been working on – from professional endeavors to personal coding experiments. I'll also be documenting my language learning journey, sharing resources that have helped me, and perhaps even posting occasional multilingual content!

Despite my busy schedule juggling work projects and learning pursuits, I always make time for the things and people I care about. Life is all about finding that delicate balance, isn't it?

This blog is my attempt to chronicle my adventures, share insights from my experiences, and connect with others who share similar interests. I hope to create content that resonates with you, inspires you, or at the very least, entertains you for a few minutes of your day.

I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to drop a comment below or reach out through any of my social channels. I've included the links at the bottom of this post. Whether you want to discuss code, practice a language, or just say hello, I'm always open to connecting with new people.

Thank you sincerely for taking the time to read this and for joining me on this journey. I'm looking forward to the conversations and connections that await!

Until next time,
Yonnon 💗
